# LeetCode Practice Plan
# LeetCode Practice Plan

Structured repository for 1â€‘month intensive algorithms & data structures practice in Python and C++.

## Layout
See directories under `python/` and `cpp/` mirroring categories.

## How to Use (Daily)
1. Open the scheduled problem (see `schedule.md`).
2. Read / restate the problem in your own words at top of file (optional addendum).
3. Implement brute force first (commit).
4. Implement optimal solution (commit).
5. Add / run tests.
6. Record any mistakes in `notes/mistakes.md`.

## Testing
Python: `pytest -q`
C++: compile individual file e.g. `g++ -std=c++17 cpp/arrays_hashing/two_sum.cpp -o /tmp/two_sum && /tmp/two_sum`

## Commit Strategy
Small focused commits: brute, optimize, test, refactor.

Happy coding!
